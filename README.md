#### Preliminary Steps for Windows user
Some codes in the following need to download files with HTTP Secure (not http).
The 'download.file' function in R does not support HTTP Secure with default 'method'.
Therefore we should change the method option of the 'download.file' function in to "curl" or "wget"
But "curl" and "wget" have not been installed basically on the Windows since those are command line tools.


You should install programs with following steps 
 0. Install Rtools (optional)
     http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/
   On the install Rtool, You should check the "Edit the System Path" and 
     add the directory which has "R.exe" file something like 
     C:\Program Files\R\R-3.1.0\bin\i386;
     for 32-bit OS (if you use 64-bit os then the last folder may be 'x64').
   After install Rtool, please check the status of system path on the CMD.
   On the CMD, type 'R' (without quotation mark) then R will be excuted
     with non-gui mode on the CMD.
 1. downlaod  nuget Command-Line Utility at
   	http://nuget.org/nuget.exe
 2. On the CMD, change directory to download folder of 'nuget.exe' and install 'chocolatey'. 
   Type the following on the CMD.
		nuget.exe install chocolatey
 3. On the CMD (not one the powershell) type the following
 @powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy unrestricted -Command "iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin
 4. Install curl and wget with following commands.s
		choco install curl
		choco install Wget
  Then we can use 'download.file' for HTTP Secure.
